    <h1> Nexus One </h1>

        The 7:th of April, 2010, Linus got his second smartphone. This time it
        was the legendary Nexus One from one of the largest internet companies
        of all time; Google inc.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Nexus One (codenamed 'HTC Passion') is Google's flagship smartphone
        manufactured by Taiwan's HTC Corporation. It became available on January
        5, 2010 and uses the Android open source mobile operating system
        Features of the phone include the ability to transcribe voice to text,
        noise canceling dual microphones, and GPS guided turn-by-turn voice
        directions to drivers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Nexus One has a 3.7 inch AMOLED screen with PenTile matrix pixel
        arrangement. The raster resolution is 480x800 pixels, however each pixel
        in the PenTile RGBG display has only two subpixels (red and green, or
        blue and green alternately), rather than the three found in most
        displays. This gives it a total effective subpixel resolution of a
        392x653 RBG display.
    </p>
    
    <!--p>
        Linus' Nexus One runs the Google Android 2.2 (Froyo) operating system.
        Android 2.2 has a number of highlights: a new Home screen, support for
        Adobe Flash 10.1, better Microsoft Exchange support, Wifi tethering,
        SD-card installable applications, cloud to device messaging for two-way
        push sync functionality and an overall 2-5x performance improvement.
