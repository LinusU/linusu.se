    <h1> Nexus One </h1>

        The 7th of April, 2010, Linus got his second smartphone. This time it
        was the legendary Nexus One from one of the largest internet companies
        of all time; Google inc.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Nexus One (codenamed 'HTC Passion') is Google's flagship smartphone
        manufactured by Taiwan's HTC Corporation. It became available on the 5th
        of January, 2010 and uses the Android open source mobile operating
        system. Features of the phone include the ability to transcribe voice to
        text, noise canceling dual microphones, and GPS guided turn-by-turn
        voice directions to drivers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Nexus One has a 3.7 inch AMOLED screen with PenTile matrix pixel
        arrangement. The raster resolution is 480x800 pixels. However, each
        pixel in the PenTile RGBG display has only two subpixels (red and green,
        or blue and green alternately), rather than the three found in most
        displays. This gives it a total effective subpixel resolution of a
        392x653 RBG display.
    </p>
    
    <!--p>
        Linus' Nexus One runs the Google Android 2.2 (Froyo) operating system.
        Android 2.2 has a number of highlights: a new Home screen, support for
        Adobe Flash 10.1, better Microsoft Exchange support, Wifi tethering,
        SD-card installable applications, cloud to device messaging for two-way
        push sync functionality and an overall 2-5x performance improvement.
